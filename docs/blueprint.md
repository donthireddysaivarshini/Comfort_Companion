## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) to evoke a sense of calmness and care. Lavender has been shown to soothe and provide comfort, much like a mother's gentle presence.
- Background color: Cream white (#FFFEF7), a very desaturated tint of lavender, will provide a comforting, warm backdrop for the user's dialogue with MindMother.
- Accent color: Gentle mint (#F0FFF0) to promote peace and serenity; a visual reminder of refreshing care.
- Font: 'Literata', a transitional serif, for both headlines and body text; chosen for its literary and slightly vintage feel, which promotes a comforting and familiar reading experience, and enhances readability for longer interactions.
- Use simple, line-based icons in the mint accent color to represent self-care suggestions. Focus on universally understandable symbols that evoke warmth and nurturing, avoiding any that may appear clinical.
- Maintain a clean and spacious layout, avoiding clutter to create a calming environment. Employ gentle curves for UI elements like message bubbles and buttons, mimicking a soft embrace.
- Incorporate subtle, gentle animations like fade-ins and smooth transitions to enrich user engagement without distraction. Animate the typing indicator and send icon with delicate easing.
